# SDP File Encryption Demo

## 1. Project Overview

This is an Android application designed to demonstrate and compare different file encryption strategies, focusing on compliance with the **NIAP Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDF PP) Version 3.3**.

The primary goal is to compare distinct `EncryptionProvider` implementations:
- **`RawHybridKeyProvider`**: The **NIAP-compliant** reference implementation. It uses raw JCA primitives to strictly control key memory lifecycles (zeroization) and supports secure lock-state operations.
- **`HybridKeyProvider`**: A standard implementation using **Google Tink's Hybrid Encryption** (ECIES).
- **`SecureKeyProvider`**: A standard implementation using **Google Tink's Envelope Encryption** (AES-GCM).
- **`RawKeyProvider`**: A manual implementation using raw Android JCA APIs (`Cipher`, `KeyStore`) wrapped in the Tink `Aead` interface.

## 2. Security Architecture & Compliance

This library is designed to meet the strict security requirements of the **NIAP Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDF PP) Version 3.3**.

### Key Implementation: `RawHybridKeyProvider`
Unlike standard high-level wrappers, our `RawHybridKeyProvider` uses raw JCA primitives to ensure full control over the key lifecycle, specifically addressing memory zeroization requirements.

* **Algorithm**: Hybrid Encryption Scheme (EC-DH + HKDF + AES-GCM).
* **Compliance Features**:
    * **FCS_CKM_EXT.4 (Key Destruction)**: Explicitly zeroes out (overwrites) plain-text DEKs and shared secrets in volatile memory immediately after use via `finally` blocks. Standard high-level libraries often rely on Garbage Collection, which is insufficient for PP compliance.
    * **FDP_DAR_EXT.2 (Locked State Operation)**: Supports encryption even when the device is locked (AFU/BFU) by leveraging a cached public key configuration, while keeping the private key securely hardware-backed in the TEE.
    * **FCS_CKM_EXT.2 (Key Generation)**: Uses `SecureRandom` for generating ephemeral Data Encryption Keys (DEKs).
    * **FCS_STG_EXT.2 (Key Storage)**: Implements Envelope Encryption where DEKs are wrapped by a TEE-backed Key Encryption Key (KEK).

## 3. Key Components

### `EncryptionProvider` Implementations

#### `RawHybridKeyProvider` (Compliant)
- **Strategy**: A robust two-tier envelope encryption designed for Common Criteria evaluation.
- **KEK (Key-Encrypting Key)**: An `EC` (Elliptic Curve) key pair stored securely in the `AndroidKeyStore` with `unlockedDeviceRequired`.
- **DEK (Data-Encapsulating Key)**: An ephemeral `AES-256-GCM` key generated via `SecureRandom` for each file.
- **Lock-State Behavior**:
    - **Encryption**: Supported in locked state. Uses a pre-shared/cached Public Key to wrap the ephemeral DEK without accessing the Keystore.
    - **Decryption**: Fails securely when locked. Requires user authentication to access the Private Key in the TEE for unwrapping.
- **Memory Safety**: Implements explicit zeroization of sensitive byte arrays immediately after use.

#### `HybridKeyProvider` (Tink Standard)
- **Strategy**: Two-tier envelope encryption using the **Google Tink** library.
- **KEK**: An `AES` key stored in the `AndroidKeyStore`.
- **DEK**: A Tink-managed ECIES keyset.
- **Note**: This implementation demonstrates the standard usage of Tink's Hybrid primitives. While secure for general use, it abstracts memory management, making it difficult to prove strict compliance with NIAP's volatile memory zeroization requirements (`FCS_CKM_EXT.4`).

#### `SecureKeyProvider` (Tink Envelope)
- **Strategy**: Standard envelope encryption using **Google Tink**.
- **KEK**: An `AES-256-GCM` key stored in the `AndroidKeyStore`.
- **DEK**: A Tink-managed `AES256_GCM` keyset, encrypted by the KEK.
- **Note**: A solid, best-practice implementation for general use cases using symmetric keys.

#### `RawKeyProvider` (JCA Adapter)
- **Strategy**: A manual implementation wrapping standard Android JCA APIs (`Cipher`, `AndroidKeyStore`) into the Tink `Aead` interface.
- **Algorithm**: `AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding`.
- **Behavior**: Generates software-backed keys and imports them into the Keystore.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates how to adapt raw platform APIs to a common interface without using the full Tink library features.

### `EncryptionManager` & `MainActivity`
- The `EncryptionManager` acts as a facade, providing a simple API for the `MainActivity` to interact with the different `EncryptionProvider`s.
- The `MainActivity` provides a UI to run encryption/decryption tests for each provider, both in unlocked and locked states, and to display the results.

### `DeviceAdminReceiver`
- This component is required to programmatically lock the screen for the "Lock & Test" feature. The user must grant Device Administrator permissions to the app for this functionality to work.

## 4. How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in a recent version of Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
4. Use the buttons on the screen to test each encryption provider.
5. To use the "Lock & Test" feature, you may need to grant Device Administrator permissions to the app via the device's settings.

## 5. Security Verification Procedure (Direct Boot & Authentication)

This section describes how to verify the application's compliance with **FDP_DAR_EXT.2** (Encryption in Locked State) and **FIA_UAU_EXT.1** (Authentication for Decryption) using the included Test Harness.

### Prerequisites
* Android Device running Android 8.0+ (Pixel device recommended).
* Screen Lock (PIN/Pattern/Password) **MUST** be set up.
* ADB tool installed and authorized.

### Verification Steps

**Step 1: Install and Initialize**
1.  Install the application (`app-debug.apk`) on the target device.
2.  Launch the app once and ensure the screen is unlocked to allow initial key generation.
3.  Force stop the app to clear memory state:
    ```bash
    adb shell am force-stop com.android.niapsec
    ```

**Step 2: Reboot into "Before First Unlock" (BFU) State**
1.  Reboot the device using ADB or the power button.
    ```bash
    adb reboot
    ```
2.  **CRITICAL:** When the device boots up, **DO NOT enter your PIN/Password**.
    * The device must remain in the "Locked" state.
    * Verify the state using:
      ```bash
      adb shell dumpsys activity | grep "mUserUnlocked"
      ```
      *Expected Output:* `mUserUnlocked=false`

**Step 3: Execute the Test Harness**
Trigger the diagnostic receiver via ADB. This component is marked as `directBootAware` and will run even when the user is locked.

1.  Start log monitoring in a terminal:
    ```bash
    adb logcat -c
    adb logcat -s DirectBootTest
    ```

2.  In a separate terminal, send the test broadcast:
    ```bash
    adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.niapsec.ACTION_TEST_CRYPTO -n com.android.niapsec/.demo.DirectBootTestReceiver
    ```

**Step 4: Verify Pass/Fail Criteria (Log Analysis)**

Check the log output for the following verification points:

#### A. Environment Validation
* `User State: LOCKED (BFU State)` -> **MUST** be Locked.
* `Storage Context: Device Protected (DE)` -> **MUST** use DE storage.

#### B. RawHybridKeyProvider (JCA Implementation)
* `[RawHybrid_JCA] Attempting Encryption...`
* `[RawHybrid_JCA] SUCCESS: Encryption completed.` -> **PASS (FDP_DAR_EXT.2 Satisfied)**
    * *Rationale:* Public Key was successfully retrieved from DE storage and used for encryption.
* `[RawHybrid_JCA] Attempting Decryption...`
* `[RawHybrid_JCA] SUCCESS: Decryption failed as expected during lock.` -> **PASS (FIA_UAU_EXT.1 Satisfied)**
    * *Rationale:* Access to the Private Key (Android Keystore) was correctly blocked by the OS because the user is not authenticated.

#### C. HybridKeyProvider (Tink Implementation)
* `[Hybrid_Tink] Attempting Encryption...`
* `[Hybrid_Tink] SUCCESS: Encryption completed.` -> **PASS (FDP_DAR_EXT.2 Satisfied)**
* `[Hybrid_Tink] Attempting Decryption...`
* `[Hybrid_Tink] SUCCESS: Decryption failed as expected during lock.` -> **PASS (FIA_UAU_EXT.1 Satisfied)**

---

### Step 5: Verify "After First Unlock" (AFU) Behavior (Optional)
1.  Unlock the screen (enter PIN).
2.  Run the broadcast command again:
    ```bash
    adb shell am broadcast -a com.android.niapsec.ACTION_TEST_CRYPTO -n com.android.niapsec/.demo.DirectBootTestReceiver
    ```
3.  Verify logs:
    * `User State: UNLOCKED (AFU State)`
    * `SUCCESS: Decryption succeeded and data matches.` -> **PASS** (Normal operation restored).
